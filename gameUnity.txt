For this project you must add and implement fighting controls over the existing script(s) so that the player can:
*Kick   [note that the kick must be random when the right mouse is clicked. There are 3 kicks animations]
*punch  [note that the punch must be random when the left mouse is clicked. I want you to know that there are 3 punches animations]
*shoots [note that you must use the 'X' key to shoot. In this case, the character shoots arrow. Use the arrow animation]
In addition:
*the character must only allow to fight when he is on the ground because right now he can jump and run.
*The character can switch to different fighting techniques (in this case kick, punch, and shoot) without problem at anytime.
*Shoot arrow while running or walking. When not shooting, the character must not stay in shooing style and stand normal again.
